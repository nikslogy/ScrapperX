Its historic headquarters is the city of Ahmednagar, and the largest cities are Ahmednagar and Sangamner. The area was once the seat of the Ahmednagar Sultanate (1496–1636 CE) and is renowned for important towns like Shirdi (linked to Sai Baba), Meherabad (linked to Meher Baba), and Shani Shinganapur. Ahmednagar district belongs to Nashik Division and borders Aurangabad, Nashik, Thane, Pune, Solapur, and Beed districts. Modern Ahmednagar was established in 1818 after the defeat of the Maratha Empire, with its present boundaries formed in 1869. It was part of the Bombay Presidency until 1947, then Bombay State, and has been in Maharashtra since 1960. During most part of the 15th century, Ahilyanagar was a battlefield controlled by the Bahmani troops. After the sultanate fell apart, the Nizam Shahi Dynasty was established which ruled the region until the 17th century. The district has notable historical and cultural remains, for instance, the fort and caves located in Takli Dhokeshwar, which date back to the mid-7th century. The famous Shirdi i...

In 1998, the district underwent a significant change when it was bifurcated to create the new Washim district. This division shaped Akola into its present form, comprising the talukas of Akola, Balapur, Patur, Barshitakli, Murtizapur, Akot, and Telhara. The name "Akola" likely comes from the Marathi word "Akol," meaning "the end" or "the boundary," reflecting the city's historical role as a frontier or administrative center in the region. Local tradition also attributes the city's name to Maharaja Akolsingh, an influential figure who is said to have played a key role in the area's history. Historically, Akola has been influenced by various cultures and rulers. Akola is part of the central part of Amravati Division, which was part of the Berar province during the British Raj. It is also the site of the famous Battle of Argaon in 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, which led to Nizam of Hyderabad to take control of all Maratha claims in Berar from Bhonsales' rule. In the Third Anglo-Maratha War, it came under the British...

Archaeological evidence of human presence in Amravati from the 11th century includes a marble statue of the Jain tirthankara Rishabhanatha, which was installed in 1097 as per its inscribed base. In the 13th century, when Govind Maha Prabhu visited, the area around Amravati was under the rule of the Hindu Yadav king of Devagiri. In 1722, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj granted Amravati and Badnera to Shri Ranoji Bhosle, after which the city, then known as Bhosle ki Amravati, was rebuilt and flourished under his leadership following the treaties of Devgaon and Anjangaon Surji and the successful capture of Gavilgad Fort in Chikhaldara. In 1853, the region of Berar (which Amravati was part of) came under British. Once under British administration, Berar was split into two districts, with Amravati’s lands included in North Berar, headquartered at Buldhana. Later, the district became part of East Berar, with Amravati as its headquarters. Over time, Yavatmal and Ellichpur districts were separate...
